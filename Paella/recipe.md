### Adjustments

* No dried peppers/chilies
* ~Double recipe of sofrito

...Cooked down to a jam
* 3 cups of rice instead of 2
* Subbed extra chicken and 12 oz. chorizo for pork tenderloin
* No clams

### Notes

* Didn't look like the rice could possibly absorb the liquid until the very last minute. Calm down and learn to trust Gritzer
* We still don't understand why the mussels and shrimp didn't overcook at 16/8+ minutes apiece. Again, trust Gritzer

### Results

* Awesome. Undersalted when adding the stock but easily fixed in post-production.
